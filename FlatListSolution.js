The solution involves several key optimizations to prevent the "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error in React Native's `FlatList`:

1. **`keyExtractor`:**  This prop is crucial for efficient rendering. It ensures that FlatList can identify each item uniquely and avoid unnecessary re-renders.  Provide a unique key for each item in your data.

2. **`getItemLayout`:**  This prop provides FlatList with the dimensions of each item beforehand, allowing for faster rendering.  For improved performance, try to use this to inform the layout of the items.

3. **`windowSize`:**  This optional prop determines how many items are rendered around the visible area. Setting an appropriate value can significantly improve performance with large datasets.

4. **Data optimization:** If possible, consider reducing or optimizing the data that's being passed to FlatList.  Avoid loading unnecessary data.

```javascript
// FlatListSolution.js
<FlatList
  data={yourData}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index.toString()}
  getItemLayout={(data, index) => ({
    length: ITEM_HEIGHT,
    offset: ITEM_HEIGHT * index,
    index,
  })}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <YourItemComponent item={item} />}
  windowSize={10} // Adjust as needed
/>
```

By implementing these optimizations, you'll significantly improve the performance of your `FlatList` and resolve the "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error.
